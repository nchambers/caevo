Meanwhile , as VOA West Africa Correspondent Purnell Murdock reports , General Abacha 's supporters began a two day rally in the capital , Abuja , to urge him to compete in this year 's election .
Nigeria state radio says thousands of people began gathering in the capital Abuja early Tuesday for the two day rally supporting General Sani Abacha 's candidacy .
Organizers state the two days of music , dancing , and speeches is expected to draw some two million people .
But as supporters of the military leader gathered in the north , riot police deployed in Nigeria 's southern commercial capital Lagos , to break up a protest rally called by the political opposition .
Although General Abacha had not publicly announced his candidacy , many people believe an Abacha presidency is a foregone conclusion .
Some analysts say the outcome of a face off between the police and anti Abacha political groups will be a test of the opposition 's resolve .
