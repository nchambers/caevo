Poughkeepsie Savings Bank said a plan to sell its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank , of Columbia , S.C. , fell through .
Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $ 8.3 million , resulting in a net loss for the third quarter .
The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well .
The thrift announced the plan Aug. 21 .
Among other reasons , high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks  substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties ,  Poughkeepsie said .
Additionally , the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ 8.5 million before taxes .
In the year-earlier third quarter , Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $ 2.8 million , or 77 cents a share .
Poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself , under a June agreement with a dissident-shareholder group .
The bank also said its effort would continue past the Nov. 1 deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result .
The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as part of the agreement .
