NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman who was watching her clothes dry in a laundromat was killed Thursday evening when two would-be robbers emptied their pistols into the store , the police said .
The men appeared in the store at 469 Vermont St. in Brownsville around 7:15 p.m. , after the victim , Linda Sanders , 35 , had finished her cleaning and was waiting for her clothes to dry , detectives said .
`` It looks as though they panicked , '' a detective , speaking on condition of anonymity , said of the robbers .
`` They intended to rob the place .
There were four or five people inside , and they just started firing . ''
Ms. Sanders was hit several times and was pronounced dead at the scene .
The other customers fled , and the police said it did not appear that anyone else was injured .
The men took no money from their victim or from the establishment , said Detective Joseph Pentangelo , a Police Department spokesman .
Victor Miranda , who lives in Ms. Sanders ' apartment building at 405 Williams Ave. , said the laundry machines in the building were removed a few years ago to make room for management offices .
