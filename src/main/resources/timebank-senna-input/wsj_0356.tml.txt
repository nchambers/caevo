Rally 's Inc. said it adopted a shareholders rights plan to protect shareholders from an inadequately priced takeover offer .
The plan provides for the distribution of one common stock-purchase right as a dividend for each share of common outstanding .
Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-half share of common for $ 30 .
Earlier this month , a group led by three of the company 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II , indicated it had a 45.2 % stake in the Louisville , Ky. , fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board .
The company said it was  concerned about the announced intent to acquire control of the company  by a Sugarman-led group .
