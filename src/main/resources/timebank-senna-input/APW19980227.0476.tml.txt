THE HAGUE , Netherlands ( AP ) _ The World Court Friday rejected U.S. and British objections to a Libyan World Court case that has blocked the trial of two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland in 1988 .
Libya , which brought the case to the United Nations ' highest judicial body in its dispute with the United States and Britain , hailed the ruling and said it would press anew for a trial in a third neutral country .
Both U.S. and British officials filed objections to the court 's jurisdiction in 1995 , claiming Security Council resolutions imposed on Lybia to force the suspects ' extradition overruled a 1971 Convention which gives Libya the right to try the men .
The decision , 3rd graf pvs .
