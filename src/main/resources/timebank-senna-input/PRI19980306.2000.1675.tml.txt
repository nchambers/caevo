More heavy gunfire in the Serbian province of Kosovo .
It 's the second day of an offensive by the security forces against villages populated by ethnic Albanians .
BBC correspondent Karyn Coleman reports from Kosovo .
There were more accounts of people fleeing from the villages near where the offensive was taking place .
They were too afraid to stay , fearing the forces may also move their operations further afield .
By mid afternoon , official Serb sources were saying the operation was over , but that has not yet been confirmed from Belgrade , the capital of Serbia , which is where the whole attack is thought to have been planned .
The ethnic Albanians here in Kosovo are considerably worried about the future and fear they are witnessing the beginnings of a much wider conflict .
