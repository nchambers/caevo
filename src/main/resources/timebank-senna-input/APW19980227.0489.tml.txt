ADDIS ABABA , Ethiopia ( AP ) _ The Organization of African Unity said Friday it would investigate the Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis in Rwanda nearly four years ago .
Foreign ministers of member-states meeting in the Ethiopian capital agreed to set up a seven-member panel to investigate who shot down Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana 's plane on April 6 , 1994 .
The assassination touched off a murderous rampage by Hutu security forces and civilians , who slaughtered mainly Tutsis but also Hutus who favored reconciliation with the minority .
It also reignited the civil war .
The panel also will look at the exodus of about 2 million Rwanda Hutus to neighboring countries where they lived in U.N.-run refugee camps for 2 1/2 years .
The investigation will consider the role of `` internal and external forces prior to the genocide and subsequently , and the role of the United Nations and its agencies and the OAU before , during and after the genocide , '' the OAU said .
The panel will be based in Addis Ababa , and will finish its investigation within a year , it said .
It is to be funded by voluntary contributions from within and outside the continent .
