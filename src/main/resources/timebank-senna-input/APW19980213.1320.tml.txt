CANBERRA , Australia ( AP ) _ Qantas will almost double its flights between Australia and India by August in the search for new markets untouched by the crippling Asian financial crisis .
This move comes barely a month after Qantas suspended a number of services between Australia , Indonesia , Thailand and Malaysia in the wake of the Asian economic crisis .
The airline has also cut all flights to South Korea .
Qantas plans daily flights between Sydney and Bombay , up from the current four flights a week , to boost business and tourism ties with India , the airline announced Friday .
In a joint statement with Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson , it said two new flights would leave Bombay on Monday and Tuesday nights from March 30 , with the third departing each Thursday from August 6 .
This will add nearly 700 seats a week on the route .
Thomson , in India to talk to tourism leaders , said the flights would provide extra support to the growing tourism market .
Qantas ' India manager Khursheed Lam said the airline was working closely with the Australian Tourist Commission to develop greater awareness of Australia in the Indian market .
Qantas will also appoint a Bombay-based public relations consultant .
