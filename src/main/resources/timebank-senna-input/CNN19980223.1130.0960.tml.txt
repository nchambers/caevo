Despite the recent possibility of military conflict with Iraq , oil prices have been falling , that 's because of a worldwide glut of oil .
Now with a diplomatic solution to the crisis seemingly at hand , get set for oil prices from the Brent north sea variety to light swede crude to fall further .
Oil prices have come down from the middle of October from a twenty-two dollar barrel level down to the fourteen dollars we 're seeing today .
That 's built up a heck of a momentum and that momentum will look to increase .
Ah next up is that thirteen dollar a barrel level we saw in the winter of nineteen ninety-four .
Weakened oil prices have already made life easier for motorists at the gas pump .
Gas prices fell nearly two cents a gallon over the last two weeks .
That according to the Lundberg survey of ten thousand gas stations nationwide .
