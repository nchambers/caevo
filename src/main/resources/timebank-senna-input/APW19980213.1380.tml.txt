CAGUAS , Puerto Rico ( AP ) _ Kidnappers kept their promise to kill a store owner they took hostage and police found the man 's dismembered and decapitated body Friday wrapped in plastic garbage bags .
Police confirmed Friday that the body found along a highway in this municipality 15 miles south of San Juan belonged to Jorge Hernandez , 49 .
Hernandez was kidnapped from his small , neighborhood store in the town of Trujillo Alto at 10 p.m. Wednesday , police said .
His kidnappers demanded a ransom of dlrs 1 million , but negotiations broke off at noon Thursday .
Police gave no details about the negotiations with the kidnappers for the return of Hernandez .
The store owner 's body was found with the arms and head cut off and the parts stuffed in separate garbage bags .
A passerby called police to report the body alongside the road .
Puerto Rico Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo urged people who might be targeted by kidnappers to be alert .
`` There has been an increase in Puerto Rico in this kind of thing and some of these bands of kidnappers are made up of foreigners , '' Toledo said .
While some Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia have suffered from a rash of kidnappings in recent years , the crime has not been common in this U.S. commonwealth .
