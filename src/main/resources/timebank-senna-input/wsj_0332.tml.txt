The offer , which values the whole of Coates at # 301 million , has already been accepted by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4 % of the company .
The acceptances give Orkem a controlling 53.2 % stake in the company .
Orkem and Coates said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger , through Orkem 's British subsidiary , Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd .
Orkem , France 's third-largest chemical group , said it would fund the acquisition through internal resources .
The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of Orkem 's U.K. unit , including the addition of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions .
Orkem said it eventually would seek to make a public share offering in its U.K. business .
