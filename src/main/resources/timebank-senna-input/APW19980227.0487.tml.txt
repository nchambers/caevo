JERUSALEM ( AP ) _ Taking the stand in her own defense , a friend of Yitzhak Rabin 's assassin said Friday that she regretted calling the prime minister a traitor and praying for his death .
Margalit Har-Shefi , 22 , has pleaded innocent to charges that she failed to report Yigal Amir 's plan to kill Rabin .
She took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate 's court .
Amir , 27 , is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally .
Newspaper reports have said Amir was infatuated with Har-Shefi and may have been trying to impress her by killing the prime minister .
Har-Shefi acknowledged she told police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor and that she prayed for him to have a heart attack and die .
She said Rabin 's murder was `` a black stain on Israel , '' Israel radio and Israel army radio reported .
Har-Shefi said she heard Amir talk about killing Rabin but did not tell the police because she did not believe he was serious .
Instead , she turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told him about Amir 's statements .
The rabbi said called the talk about killing Rabin `` nonsense , '' and said Jews are prohibited from killing one another , the radio reports said .
Har-Shefi described Amir as an `` original thinker , '' as well as delusional and a liar .
She also denied accusations made by Amir 's brother , Hagai , that she joined an anti-Arab underground movement .
She said she gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked her to help organize such a movement .
