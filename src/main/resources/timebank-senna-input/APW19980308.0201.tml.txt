ISTANBUL , Turkey ( AP ) _ Some 1,500 ethnic Albanians marched Sunday in downtown Istanbul , burning Serbian flags to protest the killings of ethnic Albanians by Serb police in southern Serb Kosovo province .
The police barred the crowd from reaching the Yugoslavian consulate in downtown Istanbul , but allowed them to demonstrate on nearby streets .
`` Stop the bloodshed in Kosovo , '' the protesters chanted .
Meanwhile in the capital , Ankara , a few hundred ethnic Albanians laid a black wreath at the gate of Yugoslavian embassy .
Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population in Kosovo , but Serbs maintain control through a large military and police presence .
Serbian police say they are trying to eliminate the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army and restore order .
At least 51 people were reported killed in clashes between Serb police and ethnic Albanians in the troubled region in recent days .
Turkey , worried about civil war in Kosovo spilling to the whole Balkans , urged all Balkan states to sign a joint declaration that the Kosovo crisis be solved peacefully and without any change of borders .
Turks feel they have special ties to the whole region , which they ruled for hundreds of years during the Ottoman Empire .
They also share Islam with the ethnic Albanians .
