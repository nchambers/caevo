Officials in California are warning residents that oncoming rains will cause dangerous and unpredictable landslides .
From member station KQED , Auncil Martinez reports .
Experts say the ground is so saturated it can not absorb any more water .
So that means soil will fall off in chunks and destroy anything in its path .
In Los Angeles that lesson was brought home today when tons of earth cascaded down a hillside , ripping two houses from their foundations .
No one was hurt , but firefighters ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and said they 'll monitor the shifting ground .
In the northern California town of Rio Nido , officials say a football field sized slab of hillside could still break loose at any time and destroy an entire neighborhood .
And in San Francisco , a mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge is slipping toward the sea .
Forecasters say the picture will get worse because more rains are on the way .
