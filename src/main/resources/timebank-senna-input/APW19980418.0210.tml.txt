He spent six days aboard the Salyut 6 spacecraft with three Soviet astronauts , Valery Kubasov , Leonid Popov and Valery Riumin .
McBride , 54 , of Lewisburg , West Virginia , was part of a seven-member crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger in October 1984 and later served as assistant administrator for congressional relations for NASA .
