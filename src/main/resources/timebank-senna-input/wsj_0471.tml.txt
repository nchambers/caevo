Dataproducts Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to block a tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners , alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns .
DPC , an investor group led by New York-based Crescott Investment Associates , had itself filed a suit in state court in Los Angeles seeking to nullify the agreement .
Earlier this year , Dataproducts had rejected a $ 15 a share offer from DPC , saying it was n't adequately financed .
DPC last week launched a new , $ 10-a-share offer for the Woodland Hills , Calif.-based computer printer maker .
DPC said it could n't comment on the suit .
