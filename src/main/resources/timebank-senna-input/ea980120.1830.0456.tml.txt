The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question are the remains inside the Tomb of the Unknown from the Vietnam War , in fact , known ?
CBS News first reported last night that the tomb may contain the remains of Air Force pilot Michael Blassie .
There was a suspicion the body was Blassie because his uniform and ID card were found near the body in Vietnam .
But subsequently , they were lost .
Blassie 's mother now wants the remains in the tomb tested for DNA .
