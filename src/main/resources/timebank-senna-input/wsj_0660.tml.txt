Montedison S.p.A. definitively agreed to buy all of the publicly held shares of Erbamont N.V. for $ 37 each .
Montedison now owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's shares outstanding .
The companies said the accord was unanimously approved by a special committee of Erbamont directors unaffiliated with Montedison .
Under the pact , Montedision will make a $ 37-a-share tender offer for Erbamont stock outstanding .
The tender offer will be followed by the sale of all of Erbamont 's assets , subject to all of its liabilities , to Montedison .
Erbamont will then be liquidated , with any remaining Erbamont holders receiving a distribution of $ 37 a share .
The companies said the transaction is being structured this way because the laws of the Netherlands Antilles , under which Erbamont is organized , do n't provide for merger transactions .
